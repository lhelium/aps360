I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left!,07-24-2016 20:30:06,757311921095925760
Today proves what I have always known that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.),07-24-2016 20:20:57,757309616254545920
Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!,07-24-2016 13:30:59,757206444148158464

Wow President Obama's brother Malik just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!,07-24-2016 11:56:43,757182723089895424
Bernie Sanders started off strong but with the selection of Kaine for V.P. is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT,07-24-2016 11:25:06,757174767547977728

Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!,07-23-2016 15:36:41,756875689924694016

Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.,07-23-2016 14:51:32,756864330054893568
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes really vicious. RIGGED,07-23-2016 10:55:20,756804886038192128

I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left!,07-24-2016 20:30:06,757311921095925760
Today proves what I have always known that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.),07-24-2016 20:20:57,757309616254545920
Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!,07-24-2016 13:30:59,757206444148158464

Wow President Obama's brother Malik just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!,07-24-2016 11:56:43,757182723089895424
Bernie Sanders started off strong but with the selection of Kaine for V.P. is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT,07-24-2016 11:25:06,757174767547977728

Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!,07-23-2016 15:36:41,756875689924694016

Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.,07-23-2016 14:51:32,756864330054893568
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes really vicious. RIGGED,07-23-2016 10:55:20,756804886038192128
